# Final Project – Airbnb Price Prediction

## Overview of First Segment 
The first segment consists of the outline of our topic. Please see the project description and file structure.

### First Segment Project Description
The following consists of the files and folder that were used to analyze and filter data:
* index.html contains the file that shows the draft of our final project presentation
* static/js/logic.js contains the file that has D3 and Leaflet information to show the map and location.
* static/css/style.css contains files that show the styling of the website.
* static/sf_map.html contains files that show the map and location.
* Resources folder contains CSV files for our dataset.
* SF_airbnb_EDA.ipynb contains a Jupyter Notebook file to explore and analyze data.
* practice_model.ipynb contains a Jupyter Notebook file to analyze data using Machine learning model and algorithm.
* SanFranciscoNeighborhoods.json contains GeoJSON file for the map information.
* schema.sql contains the file to show the database schema.


## Overview of Second Segment
In this segment, we continued doing more Data Exploration, got some visualization to help with our analysis, and we started exploring possible Machine Learning Models for our project.

### Second Segment Project Description
The following consists of the files and folder addition that were used to analyze and filter data:
* index.html contains the file that shows the draft of our project presentation
* images folder contains graph images

#### Data exploration phase of the projects: 
* Please refer to SF_Airbnb_EDA_v2.ipynb file

#### Analysis phase of the projects: 
* Please refer to SF_Airbnb_Data_Visualization.ipynb
* Exploration of Data & Data Analysis word document file


## Overview of the Third Segment
In this segment, we continued trying out Machine Learning models to improve our results, worked on our project's dashboard and, started our presentation's slides draft.

### Third Segment Project Description
* Resources/cleaned_aribnb_datatset4.csv, is our new complete dataset.
* Cleaned_Merged_dataset.ipynb contains a Jupyter Notebook where we merged our previous dataset with a new one called MeanZIP-3.xlsx - nation.csv, and then cleaned it.
* Random_Forest_Numerical.ipynb contains a Jupyter Notebook file to implement Random Forrest Regression model of numerical features from our dataset.
* RandomForestRegressor_Categorical.ipynb contains a Jupyter Notebook file to implement Random Forrest Regression model of categorical features from our dataset.
* RandomForestRegressor_Combo.ipynb contains a Jupyter Notebook file to implement Random Forrest Regression model of all features from our dataset.

#### Communication Protocols: 
In order to keep updated on the status of each of our parts of the project, we message each other regularly through Slack and organized regular zoom meetings.
